# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

We do believe that the mentioned project team should be enough to succesfully finish the project.


## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

Nothing we can think of right now. 


## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

We should have all the tools and tech at hand. Support by selected cloud providers would be an asset of course. 


## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

TBD


## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

Time and brainpower should be the main reqirements. Support by the R community and cloud providers would be a plus.
