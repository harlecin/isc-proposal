# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

1. Collaboration platform: All code will hosted publicly on a git repository. All contributors will have clear responsabilites and work packages.
2. Licence: We are planning to license under the commonly used [MIT License](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/MIT).
3. Reporting: As mentioned above, ideally github will serve as main collaboration platform. Therefore, all changes, progress and issues will be reported there.

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery

Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.
