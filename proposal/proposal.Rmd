## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

We want to help R developers to leverage serverless computing for training and scoring R models. We want to build a plattform independent framework that allows R developers to deploy their solution to different cloud providers with a consistent, unified API.

We want to build a framework similar to [serverless.com](http://serverless.com/) but specifically targeted to R users.

R developers should be able to:

- deploy arbitrary R code using an arbitary R runtime
- using a consistent API for different cloud providers

We want to build a CLI to provision:
- Serverless batch jobs
- Serverless functions
