# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

A working framework that enables R-users to send commands to at least one supported cloud provider via Rstudio on a CLI (GUI might follow later).


## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->
For a first PoC a full implementition on MS Azure is considered. A first prototyp has been already created there. 

Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
Achievable (agreed, attainable).
Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->




## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs
